There are many reason why dogs are called humans' best friends: not only do they offer 
unparalleled companionship, but a growing body of research shows they also boost human 
health. Owning a dog can prompt you to be more physically active â€” have leash, will walk. 
It can also help you be calmer, more mindful, and more present in your life; 
make kids more active, secure, and responsible; 
improve the lives of older individuals; 
make you more social and less isolated.
